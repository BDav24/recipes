## Directions

### Step 1

Peel the carrots, onion and garlic. Cut the carrots into slices of about 7 millimetres. Chop the garlic. Peel and coarsely chop the mushrooms.

### Step 2

Slice the meat into cubes of about 4 cm side, remove the large pieces of fat. Then fry for a few minutes over high heat with the lardons in a casserole, stirring well until all the pieces are golden brown.

### Step 3

Add the onions and carrots and leave to brown for 2-3 minutes, still on high heat.

### Step 4

Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter, then stir in the flour in small amounts, stirring between spoonfuls to prevent lumps.

### Step 5

Deglaze with the wine (about 10 cL) and boil. Add the garlic. Add salt and pepper to taste.

### Step 6

Add wine so as to immerse the meat and vegetables, lower the heat, add the bouquet garni, and simmer gently for about 2h45. Add the mushrooms 20 minutes before the end of cooking.

### Step 7

Remove the bouquet garni. Serve with steamed potatoes or pasta (tagliatelle for example).

> You can also make this dish the day before and simmer it again for 1 to 2 hours the next day, it will be even better. Add wine or water if necessary.
