## Directions

### Step 1

Peel the carrots, onion and garlic. Prick the onion with the cloves and cut it in 4. Chop the garlic. Slice the carrots, celery and leek whites into slices of about 7 millimetres. Peel and coarsely chop the mushrooms.

### Step 2

Slice the meat into cubes of about 4 centimetres, then blanch it: in a casserole, bring 2 litres of water to the boil, then plunge the pieces of meat into it for 1 minute. Collect the veal pieces with a skimmer or sieve. Run the meat under cold water, drain it and put it back in the bottom of the pot.

### Step 3

Add the vegetables and herbs to the casserole: onion, garlic, leek, celery, carrots and bouquet garni. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add the wine and then water so as to submerge the meat and vegetables. Cover, bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 1h30 (simmering water). Add the mushrooms and 3/4 of the lemon juice 20 minutes before the end of cooking.

### Step 4

Meanwhile, prepare a blond roux: melt the butter in a saucepan, sprinkle it with the flour, mix with a wooden spatula or a whisk until the butter has been completely absorbed and the whole thing is lightly browned, then stop cooking and leave to cool.

### Step 5

Once the meat and vegetables are cooked, collect the cooking broth in a container. Turn the heat back on under the saucepan containing the roux, pour the broth in several times and stir constantly to dilute the roux. Bring to a boil to thicken the sauce.

### Step 6

Finally, put the meat and vegetables (without the herbs: bay leaf, cloves) back into the casserole, mix it with the sauce and heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Just before serving, mix the cream and the egg yolks, then add this mixture to the sauce, stirring constantly so as not to boil. Flavour with the rest of the lemon juice, then place in a deep dish and decorate if desired with sprigs of parsley.

> Blanquette de veau is frequently served with white rice, but you can vary the pleasure by accompanying it with steamed potatoes, stewed celery hearts or cauliflower.
